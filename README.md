Repo of Theseus
Each commit, the programmer would replace a line of code he wrote into a line written by AI. 
A question was raised by ancient philosophers: After several hundreds of years of maintenance, 
if each individual line of the code of Theseus were replaced, one after the other, was it still the same repo?
